# AutoRegressive-Models
Autoregressive models for time series forecasting. 
These classes and functions are thought to help people in manipulating time series data and offer all the necessary tools to develop different machine learning models on these data.

In this model lag features are considered to learn from past behaviour a future time horizon (also larger then 1). 
This model use standard machine learning models to infer the relationship in the time series. 
All the classes of models which have a fit and predict methods can be used
