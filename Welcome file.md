# AutoRegressive Models for Time Series Forecasting

## Intro
Autoregressive models infer the time relation in a time series by studying the relation between the past data (also colled **lags**) and the data at a certain time **horizon** in the future
$$
f(y_{t-1},\dots,y_{t-d}) \approx y_t \;.
$$

Here $f$ denotes a certain models which depends on the machine learning estimator which is used to train the autoregresive model.
